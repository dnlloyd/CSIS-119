You wanna hear more? Well, I model in blender, I also typically texture my models in there too.
My games are made in unity, and I'm working on a big one right now. I am pretty happy with it so far!

I have a cat named Kono, and he's pretty neat. Even though he's really nice he is needy, so he can get on my nerves.
My friends always say he looks weirdly human for a cat. Which... I can't help but to agree with. I have an uncanny cat.
At least he's expressive...

How many pets do you have?
Your Pets:52

My aspirations are pretty clean cut. I want to make successful games!
This is hard though, and I need to pay bills so I can avoid dying, so I would like to be a software developer in the meantime.
Also I aspire to match this criteria!
